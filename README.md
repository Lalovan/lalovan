## Hello there 👋

👩‍💻 I’m a data-driven problem solver with a strong interest in machine learning, data science, and building innovative, end-to-end solutions.
I’m currently enrolled in the AI & ML Data Science Bootcamp at BeCode.

## 🚀 What drives me ##
🔍 Passionate about finding robust solutions to real-world (fictionous is also fine) problems

🧠 Naturally curious — I like understanding why things work (or don't), not just how

🧪 Enjoy math, exploring data, look into the details (to a healthy extent), spotting patterns, and validating assumptions

📈 Highly appreciate coordination, structure, and end-to-end pipelines

🌱 Constantly learning and improving

## 🦒 How do I put a giraffe into a fridge (...or how I approach projects)? ##
- Start by clearly understanding the problem, context, and constraints
- Explore multiple angles before committing to a solution
- Break complex problems into manageable, well-defined steps
- Prioritize solutions that are robust, explainable, and scalable
- Iterate based on feedback, results, and real-world impact

***No giraffe was harmed in the process.** 

## 🎯 Current focus ##
- Deepening my expertise of Data Science and ML
- Building portfolio projects
- Exploring opportunities at the intersection of AI and entrepreneurship, in diverse fields (e.g. mental health, )
